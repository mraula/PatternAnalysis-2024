# Lesion Detection using YOLOv8

## Problem Introduction
Lesion detection in skin images, such as those provided by the ISIC dataset, helps identify potential melanomas. The problem we aim to solve is automating the detection of lesions within the ISIC 2017/8 data set with a detection network
such as the YOLOv7 or newer with all detections having a minimum
Intersection Over Union of 0.8 on the test set and a suitable accuracy for classification.
